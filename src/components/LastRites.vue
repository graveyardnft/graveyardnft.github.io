      <p class="mb-4">The Graveyard NFT project is the final resting place for your rugged NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">“Rugged” has many meanings in this space, be it project failure to deliver, lack of community, or just plain old scams and empty promises.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The graveyard team feel it’s important to have goals that are deliverable. This is reflected in the mint price and the promised utility being offered.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The graveyard is open to all ERC721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, but remember tokens sent to the graveyard can NEVER be recovered. This is just like burning but you are sending them to the Graveyard and not to the null/dead address.</p>

      <p class="mt-4 mb-4">The Graveyard project consists of 3 parts:</p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-xl">The Graveyard</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This is where your tokens are sent, and $URN rewards can be claimed.</p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-xl">$CRYPT NFT’s</p>
      <p class="mb-4">These are the projects NFT’s which associate ownership with tokens sent to the graveyard.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">$CRYPT artwork is fully on chain, they have a “spookiness” attribute which acts like a multiplier on $URN rewards claimable.</p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-xl">$URN</p>
      <p class="mb-4">$URN is a ERC20 token of no fixed supply, yielded by $CRYPT’s and returned for tokens sent to the Graveyard.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">$URN may be used/burnt for future benefits outside of the promised utility of $CRYPT’s either directly by the project or through partnerships.</p>

      <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-xl">Why send tokens to the Graveyard?</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The graveyard can act much like the null/dead address, however the tokens sent here are curated by the senders to be specifically “rugged” projects.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Anybody can send tokens to the Graveyard, however only $CRYPT holders are incentivised to do so.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">As an owner of $CRYPT NFT’s in return for sending NFT’s to the graveyard you get:</p>
      <p class="mb-4">1. A clean address, some marketplaces provide a way to hide these tokens on your profile, others do not and no two marketplaces share the ability to hide across their platforms.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">2. A website page on http://graveyardnft.com/ where you can return, reminisce, maybe even laugh at the tokens you chose to mint that later failed.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">3. Rewards for participating in the form of $URN (1000 $URN * number of $CRYPT's in holders wallet for each token sent) + daily yielded $URN.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The project benefits through the ability to query the data of the tokens sent, this data could be used in generative art collections, mapping of contract/creator information, statistical project identifiers, and identification of common patterns that may be beneficial to preemptively identify bad actors, through on chain address matching and/or association of blockchain data and social accounts. These ideas are not specific to the graveyard, the data is public and no future utility is promised, but we are excited where this takes us. And we would support and encourage any project/team/community members to consider using the data in creative ways too.</p>
