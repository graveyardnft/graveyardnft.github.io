      <p class="mb-4">The Graveyard NFT project is the final resting place for your unsuccessful NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">They could be unsuccessful for any number of reasons: lack of community, lack of delivery, roadmap lost its way, or just plain old dev rugs.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The graveyard is open to all ERC721 tokens. No longer shall your marketplace’s hidden token tab be cluttered with tokens you wish weren’t in your wallet.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Committal transfers ownership to the contract, and **they are no longer in your control or owned by you**, it’s a similar concept to burning.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This is <strong class="font-bold">NOT staking</strong>, you no longer own the token, and **tokens sent to the graveyard can never be recovered**.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Committing NFTs to the Graveyard is your last action as the token holder. This is the graveyards primary utility. The tokens will no longer appear in your wallet (just like burning) as they are no longer owned by you. The primary difference to burning is you can always go back and see your tokens in your <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong>, and in return receive $URN which may be useful in the future.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">For your NFT committal to be recorded in the Obituary logs, you MUST use the {safeTransferFrom} method provided by ERC721 standard. Tokens sent using the usual {transferFrom} will NOT be recorded in the Obituary.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The committal act can be performed directly from NFT token contracts. Additionally, the Graveyard NFT project provides a dApp hosted on IPFS to make this process easier.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Furthermore, the Graveyard contract provides a batch transfer method to reduce gas costs for sending multiple tokens from multiple contracts.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Graveyard has a place for all tokens, but some tokens are more equal than others.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Graveyard has a limited number of <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong>s (<strong class="font-bold">max 6969</strong>).</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Owners of <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong>s receive the ability to display all tokens sent to the Graveyard from the address that also owns the <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong>, and own the rights to the generated artwork for their <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> token.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Graveyard dApp displays the Committed tokens housed in each <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> (all tokens sent to the Graveyard by the <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> owner).</p>
      <p class="mb-4">A transfer in ownership of the CRYPT changes what is displayed in the <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> to the tokens committed by the new owner.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Each token committed to the Graveyard returns $URN to the sender if they hold a <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong>.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> owners receive 1000 $URN per token * the number of <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong>s owned for each committal.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">$URN is a token that follows the ERC20 token standard and has no fixed supply.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">$URN is a token enshrined in the Ethereum ledger.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">$URN has no explicit utility or value; the Graveyard project will **NOT** provide liquidity pools for $URN. We will however document any liquidity pools created for community protection.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Additionally <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> holders receive a daily yield of $URN at a rate of 10-19.5 $URN per <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> (variable on <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> spookiness).</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Receiving $URN by committing failed NFT tokens to the graveyard records fractionalisation of interactions with the graveyard project. The more Tokens you send to the graveyard the more $URN you receive.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We would like $URN to become a symbol for community, where new projects recognise people have been burnt before (no pun intended) and give back through usage of $URN.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Being accessible by other smart contracts means $URN could have various use cases in the future.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">There are no plans or promises, but some possible use cases may include burning/transferring $URN to mint new project tokens, whitelist allocations specific to $URN holders or burning $URN to influence rarity.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The graveyard team will approach new projects where this is suitable, and we would encourage the community to do the same, we are open to discussing with any new project and any wonderful ideas for it uses.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Again 1 $URN = 1 $URN future utility is not set in stone, your support of the project guarantees ownership of <strong class="font-bold">$CRYPT</strong> with associated art, $URN tokens and the dApp hosted on IPFS. We will never promise anything we cannot 100% guarantee, that is where many of the projects that will end up in the graveyard go wrong.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">No other projects will be able to mint $URN, but the Graveyard project team can enable transferring and/or burning $URN to specific contracts.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This would prevent the need for $URN token approvals (and the associated gas costs) for $URN holders interacting with other contracts.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Graveyard project team would only enable this feature for contracts/projects/teams that meet the following criteria, which could also be revoked or updated at any time:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4">
        <li>Contract is verified on Etherscan;</li>
        <li>Contract appears to be safe;</li>
        <li>The amount of URN is a constant/predictable quantity, unchangeable by the contract owners; and</li>
        <li>The team/project/ethos is complementary to the Graveyard projects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">Approval of URN usage in other project contracts does NOT indicate the Graveyard project has audited, is affiliated with or endorses the external project.</p>
